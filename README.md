# EMDR-App

Inspired by the code from [DazzlingDukeOfLazers'](https://github.com/DazzlingDukeOfLazers/emdr) html app, I created this one.

## Features: 
- Smooth, pleasant image.
- Adjustable speed, ball size, audio frequency, and volume.
- 4 types of audio.
- Stereo, lateralizing sound.

For Windows users, you can just [download](https://github.com/sm18lr88/EMDR-App/releases/download/v0.1/EMDR-App.zip) the .zip file with the app in it.

Please note, the animation is designed to work best at the common 1920 * 1080 screen resolution.

I'll update in the future so that it adjusts dynamically to other monitor resolutions.

Here's video preview of me pressing the arrows to change the various settings (mouse pointer doesn't show). The sound of the app is better than in this recording. Listen at low audio level because some audio settings sound harsh.
