# EMDR-App

Inspired by the code from [DazzlingDukeOfLazers'](https://github.com/DazzlingDukeOfLazers/emdr) html app, I created this one.

For Windows users, you can just [download](https://github.com/sm18lr88/EMDR-App/releases/download/v0.1/EMDR-App.zip) the .zip file with the app in it.

Please note, the animation is designed to work at the common 1920 * 1080 screen resolution.

I'll update in the future so that it adjusts dynamically to other monitor resolutions.
